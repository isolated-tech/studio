## Overview

Our agency partnered with i18nLocale to develop a powerful yet user-friendly translation platform for developers. The client needed a solution that would support 200+ languages, maintain local-first functionality for data security, handle multiple file formats, and offer both free and premium subscription optionsâ€”all supported by Stripe while presenting complex technical capabilities in an accessible way.

We designed a clean, developer-friendly interface highlighting code examples with dark/light theme options and clear distinctions between features and pricing tiers. The technical implementation leveraged Transformers.js, a custom AI translation engine, and WebAssembly to enable powerful in-browser processing without server dependencies.

Key features included an intuitive code interface demonstrating real-time translation examples, comprehensive language support with a searchable interface, seamless handling of JSON, and YAML files, and a straightforward two-tier pricing model (free forever plan and one-time $20 purchase for premium features).
