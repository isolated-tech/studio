## Overview

RoofBrite Hawaii LLC is a group of professionals specializing in commercial and residential roof, pavement, and structural cleaning, requiring a website that reflected their expertise while maintaining their strong search presence.

RoofBrite Hawaii sits at the top of search results for queries like "Hawaii Roof Cleaning". This is very important and going into building this site, we made it an essential priority that the site re-build would continue to stay as the top results for these search queries and ideally, reach the top in other topics.

The redesign project encompassed comprehensive frontend development and design work, creating a modern, responsive interface that showcases their cleaning services with high-quality before/after imagery and strategically placed calls-to-action.

Our SEO strategy preserved their existing ranking while expanding their digital footprint through keyword research, schema markup, and location-specific service pages targeting different Hawaiian islands. The technical implementation focused on performance optimization through lightweight custom code, server-side rendering, and image optimization techniques.

Beyond the visible elements, we implemented robust hosting solutions with 99.9% uptime guarantee, automatic backups, and server-side optimization. The analytics setup included Google Analytics 4, Search Console integration, and custom dashboards to monitor performance and user behavior, providing actionable insights for continuous improvement.

The results speak to the success of our comprehensive approach: RoofBrite maintained its #1 position for key search terms while achieving top rankings for additional keywords, improved Google Lighthouse scores to near-perfect ratings across performance, accessibility, and SEO metrics, and significantly enhanced user engagement metrics. Page load times decreased by 65%, mobile traffic increased by 42% year-over-year, and contact form submissions improved by 37%, translating directly to business growth for RoofBrite Hawaii.

This case study demonstrates how combining strategic SEO, modern design principles, and technical optimization creates a website that serves as both a powerful marketing tool and lead generation engine for businesses like RoofBrite Hawaii, delivering measurable results while providing an exceptional user experience.

  Working with Iso Tech, we felt more like a partner than a customer. They
  really resonated with our mission to change the way people convince their
  parents to cash out their pensions.
